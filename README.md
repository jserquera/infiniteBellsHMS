# infiniteBellsHMS
With less than 30 KB of code you can design and play infinite bell sounds. Based on the HMS technique, or Histogram Mapping Synthesis. It is comprised of two files, a small patch and a text file with envelopes (out of histograms).


# More about HMS

## Brief description:

HMS is based on Cellular Automata (CA) which are mathematical/computational models that create moving images. In the context of HMS, these images are analysed by histogram measurements, giving as a result a sequence of histograms. In a nutshell, these histogram sequences are converted into spectrograms which in turn are rendered into sounds. Unlike other CA-based systems, the HMS mapping process is not intuition-based or totally arbitrary; it is based on resemblances discovered between the histogram sequence components and sound spectral components.
